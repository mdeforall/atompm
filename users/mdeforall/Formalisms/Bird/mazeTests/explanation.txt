An explanation for how the tests are formatted:
puzzle[#]_{[Rule#][RType][Direction][LoopCount#]}_[S/F/E]_[OtherNotes].model


#: The number of the puzzle. For puzzle 1, this looks like puzzle1

Rule#: Which step the rule is on. Doesn't count the start rule. For example,
       the first rule gets the number "1" and the 6th rule gets "6"

RType: Whether the rule is a normal LHS/RHS rule (R), or a Query rule (Q).
       If it's a Query rule, the Direction and LoopCount# are ignored.

Direction: Whether the bird in the rule is facing NSEW or is turning (T).
       If turning, LoopCount# is ignored.

LoopCount#: The number of times the rule loops before moving to the next.

The section surrounded by {} is repeated for every rule.

S/F/E: Whether the puzzle rules make the pattern succeed (S), fail (F),
       or error (E). Fails or Errors usually contain context in OtherNotes.
       If not supposed to fail or error, will include S immediately after.

OtherNotes: When a puzzle pattern requires context for some aspect of
       the rules.


Example:

puzzle7_1RT_2RE5_S_TileBG.model
- 7th puzzle
- 2 rules:
  - First is a Rule (R), and is a turn rule (T)
  - Second is a Rule (R), birds are facing east (E), and it loops 5 times
- The puzzle succeeds
- Context: The turn rule has tiles underneath the birds
